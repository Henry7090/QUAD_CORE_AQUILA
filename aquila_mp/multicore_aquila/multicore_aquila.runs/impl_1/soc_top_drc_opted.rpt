DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP genblk1[0].Aquila_SoC/RISCV_CORE/Execute/MulDiv/mul00 output genblk1[0].Aquila_SoC/RISCV_CORE/Execute/MulDiv/mul00/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#2 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP genblk1[0].Aquila_SoC/RISCV_CORE/Execute/MulDiv/mul00__0 output genblk1[0].Aquila_SoC/RISCV_CORE/Execute/MulDiv/mul00__0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#3 Warning
PREG Output pipelining

Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.

DPOP-1#4 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP genblk1[1].Aquila_SoC/RISCV_CORE/Execute/MulDiv/mul00__0 output genblk1[1].Aquila_SoC/RISCV_CORE/Execute/MulDiv/mul00__0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0).

DPOP-2#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP genblk1[0].Aquila_SoC/RISCV_CORE/Execute/MulDiv/mul00 multiplier stage genblk1[0].Aquila_SoC/RISCV_CORE/Execute/MulDiv/mul00/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.

REQP-1709#1 Warning
Clock output buffering  
PLLE2_ADV connectivity violation. The signal MIG/u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/pll_clk3_out on the MIG/u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i/CLKOUT3 pin of MIG/u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i does not drive the same kind of BUFFER load as the other CLKOUT pins. Routing from the different buffer types will not be phase aligned.
